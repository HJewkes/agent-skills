# Executing Plans — Guardrails

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** — stop and ask.

## Checklist

- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Read briefing files per-batch, not all at once
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
