# Brainstorming Detailed Process

## Understanding the Idea

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message — if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

## Exploring Approaches

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

## Presenting the Design

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `.claude/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation:**
- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Design Quality

When presenting the design, include sections for:
- **Test strategy**: How will this be tested? What are the key test cases? (Consult tdd-principles.md)
- **Error handling**: What can go wrong? How will errors be diagnosed? (Consult debugging-principles.md)
- **Verification criteria**: How will we know this works? What specific commands/checks confirm success? (Consult verification-principles.md)

These sections should be proportional to the design's complexity — a simple feature gets a few bullets, a complex system gets detailed plans.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** — Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** — Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** — Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
