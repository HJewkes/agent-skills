# Plan Format Specifications

Templates and schemas for the plan directory structure generated by `writing-plans`.

## Orchestration Plan Format (plan.md)

The orchestration plan is what the coordinator reads. It contains NO inline code and NO step-by-step instructions — those live in briefing files. Target: under 200 lines.

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

## Dependency Graph

[Which tasks depend on which — text or ascii diagram]

## Wave Plan

- **Wave 1** (parallel): Task 1, Task 2
- **Wave 2** (depends on Wave 1): Task 3

## Tasks

| # | Name | Files | Wave | Depends On |
|---|------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | [name] | `src/a.ts`, `tests/a.test.ts` | 1 | — |
| 2 | [name] | `src/b.ts` | 1 | — |
| 3 | [name] | `src/c.ts` | 2 | Task 1 |

Detailed task specs: `./briefings/task-NN.md`
```

## Manifest Format (manifest.json)

Machine-readable metadata the coordinator reads at wave boundaries to recover from context compaction.

```json
{
  "planId": "YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name",
  "createdAt": "ISO-8601",
  "goal": "One sentence",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-01",
      "name": "Component Name",
      "briefing": "briefings/task-01.md",
      "wave": 1,
      "dependsOn": [],
      "fileOwnership": ["src/path/a.ts", "tests/path/a.test.ts"],
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ],
  "waves": [
    { "id": 1, "tasks": ["task-01", "task-02"], "gate": "tests pass + lint clean" },
    { "id": 2, "tasks": ["task-03"], "gate": "tests pass + lint clean" }
  ]
}
```

## Briefing Authoring Rules

- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in briefing (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- File ownership: explicit allowlist per task
- Success criteria: every criterion maps to a runnable command
- Anti-patterns: include universal 3 (file ownership, no CLAUDE.md edits, no scope creep) + task-specific
- Target: under 50 lines of meaningful content per briefing (excluding code blocks)

### Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step within a briefing is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step
