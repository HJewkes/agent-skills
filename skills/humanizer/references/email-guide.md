# Email Writing Guide

## Structure
- First sentence states the purpose or ask
- One ask per email — if you have multiple, number them
- End with a clear next step or deadline if applicable
- Skip sign-off for internal/casual emails; use "Thanks" for external

## Tone
- Match the formality of the relationship, not the "importance" of the topic
- Teammates: casual, direct
- External/new contacts: polite but still concise
- Never more formal than the person you're replying to

## Anti-patterns
- No "I hope this finds you well" — get to the point
- No "Please don't hesitate to reach out"
- No "As per our previous discussion" — just reference what was said
- No "I wanted to follow up on" — just follow up
- No subject lines that are full sentences
- No "Best regards" for internal teammates

## Length
- Most emails: 3-5 sentences
- If it needs more than 10 sentences, consider whether it should be a doc instead
