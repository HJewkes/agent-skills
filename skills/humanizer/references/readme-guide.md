# README Writing Guide

## Structure
- Open with one sentence that says what this is and why you'd use it
- Show the install/run command immediately — don't bury it
- Only document what isn't obvious from reading the code
- Skip sections that don't apply (Contributing, License, etc.)

## Tone
- Direct and factual — no marketing language
- Write like you're explaining to a colleague, not selling to a customer
- "This tool does X" not "This powerful tool empowers you to X"

## Anti-patterns
- No "Welcome to ProjectName!" openers
- No "comprehensive" or "robust" feature descriptions
- No bullet lists where a sentence works better
- No heading for every paragraph — use headings only when switching topics
- No excessive badge rows
- No features lists with present participles ("Providing seamless integration")
- No "Getting Started" section that only contains obvious instructions

## Length
- For small tools/libraries: 20-50 lines
- For complex projects: up to 200 lines, but only if every line earns its place
