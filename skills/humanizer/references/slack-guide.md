# Slack Message Guide

## Structure
- Lead with the point or question
- Use threads for context — don't dump walls of text in channels
- One message per thought — don't combine unrelated topics
- For decisions, state the proposal and ask for thumbs up/down

## Tone
- Conversational — write like you talk
- Fragments are fine. So are one-word responses.
- Use channel conventions (some teams are formal, most aren't)

## Anti-patterns
- No paragraph-length messages for simple questions
- No formal greetings ("Good morning team,") — just say the thing
- No sign-offs ("Best," "Thanks,") — it's chat, not email
- No bullet lists for 2-3 items — just write a sentence
- No "Regarding the X from yesterday:" — link to the thread or message
- No "Just wanted to check in on" — ask the actual question

## Length
- Most messages: 1-2 sentences
- If it's more than 4 lines, use a thread or move to a doc
